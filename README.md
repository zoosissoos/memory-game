# memory-game

This is a Memory game demonstrating React state and functional components. To play the game, click on a tile piece. The tiles will then randomize. Try to not click a previously clicked tile.

## Getting Started

You may run locally otherwise below is a link to the deployed project. 

### Prerequisites/Technologies Used

React
material-ui
GitHub Pages

### Installing

In Terminal once in root directory:
-perform "yarn install" 
-followed by "yarn start"

### Future development

I wish to involve conditional rendering where the Welcome screen would be replaced by the scoreboard once one of the game tiles was clicked.

## Deployment
